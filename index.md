I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Cancer Data Science Laboratory at NIH/NCI under the mentorship of <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/staff-directory/lichun-ma">Dr. Lichun Ma</a>. My research focuses on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, with an emphasis on developing AI- and machine learning–driven methodologies to analyze high-dimensional cancer genomics data. In particular, I aim to uncover latent biological patterns, spatial organization, and tumor heterogeneity to advance data-driven insights in cancer research.

Beyond my current work, during my Ph.D. I developed strong interests in leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and wearable technologies to address critical healthcare challenges. This included work on noninvasive monitoring of physiological metrics such as glucose levels and opioid overdose detection. I also worked on building power-efficient Spiking Neural Networks, identifying neuromorphic hardware faults using machine learning, and semiconductor wafer testing, like good die in bad neighborhood and defect classification.

I completed my Ph.D. at Drexel University, where I had the privilege of being supervised by professors <a href="https://drexel.edu/engineering/about/faculty-staff/K/kandasamy-nagarajan/">Nagarajan Kandasamy </a> and <a href="http://anupkdas.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html"> Anup Das</a>. 

I completed my Master of Science degree with research thesis in 2020 under the guidance of professor <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~doermann/index.html">David Doermann</a> at SUNY Buffalo.

I am currently in my 4th year as a Ph.D. candidate at Drexel University, where I have the privilege of being supervised by professors <a href="https://drexel.edu/engineering/about/faculty-staff/K/kandasamy-nagarajan/">Nagarajan Kandasamy </a> and <a href="http://anupkdas.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html"> Anup Das</a>. Additionally, I am a member of the  <a href="https://drexeldisco.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html">D.I.S.C.O. Lab</a>. 

My research interest lies in exposing neuromorphic hardware faults using machine learning, Spiking Neural Network, Semiconductor wafer defect classification, NLP, and understanding neurophysiological data (EEG, ECG, PPG etc).

I completed my Master of Science degree with research thesis in 2020 under the guidance of <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~doermann/index.html">Professor David Doermann</a> at SUNY Buffalo.

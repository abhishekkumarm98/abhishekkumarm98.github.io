I am currently in my 4th year as a Ph.D. candidate at Drexel University, where I have the privilege of being supervised by professors <a href="https://drexel.edu/engineering/about/faculty-staff/K/kandasamy-nagarajan/">Nagarajan Kandasamy </a> and <a href="http://anupkdas.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html"> Anup Das</a>. Additionally, I am a member of the  <a href="https://drexeldisco.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html">D.I.S.C.O. Lab</a>. 

My research interests include leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and wearable technologies to address critical healthcare challenges, particularly in noninvasive monitoring of physiological metrics such as glucose levels and opioid overdose detection. Additionally, I am focused on exposing neuromorphic hardware faults using machine learning and Spiking Neural Networks, as well as semiconductor wafer defect classification and natural language processing.


I completed my Master of Science degree with research thesis in 2020 under the guidance of professor <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~doermann/index.html">David Doermann</a> at SUNY Buffalo.
